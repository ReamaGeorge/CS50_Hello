            <p>Git is a command line tool that will help us with version control in several different ways:</p>
            <div>
                <ul>
                    <li>Allowing us to keep track of changes we make to our code by saving snapshots of our code at a given point in time.</li>
                    <li>Allowing us to easily synchronise code between different people working on the same project by allowing multiple people to pull information from and push information to a repository stored on the web</li>
                    <li>Allowing us to make changes to and test out code on a different branch without altering our main code base, and then merging the two together.</li>
                    <li>Allowing us to revert back to earlier versions of our code if we realise we’ve made a mistake.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>A Git repository is a file location where we’ll store all of the files related to a given project. These can either be remote (stored online) or local (stored on your computer).</p>
